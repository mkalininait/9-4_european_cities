# World cities by population

## Summary
This tiny Shiny app lets you display all world cities with population in the given range and with a focus on a chosen area.

## Data
The data on the world cities comes from the [simplemaps.com](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities) website. We used the Basic database. The database was updated in 2019.

## How to use the app
Simply input the range of population using the two-ended slider and select the part of the world you'd like to focus on. The map will update automatically.
